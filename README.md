# Reinforcement Learning Model for the Chrome Dino game

A notebook that gives the process of creating a custom game environment, creating the step and reward functions, and training a DQN model for 250,000 epochs to learn how to play the chrome Dino game. The high schore achieved by the trained model is 612.

## Overview

This project explores the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for audio classification tasks. The goal is to classify .wav files into the following 10 categories: 'dog_bark', 'children_playing', 'car_horn', 'air_conditioner', 'street_music',
 'gun_shot', 'siren', 'engine_idling', 'jackhammer', and 'drilling'. Through applying various deep learning methods and model structures, this notebook outlines the complete process of taking raw data, cleaning it, transforming it, creating some (poor) baseline models, evaluating the metrics, and eventually creating a classification network with a 91.5% prediction success rate.

## Usage

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nogalcy/chrome-dino-AI.git
   cd chrome-dino-AI
2. Run the 'dino-AI.ipynb' notebook in order to get full results, this notebook will install dependencies, create the game env, and you can skip the training code to simply load the model provided (best_model_250000.7z)
